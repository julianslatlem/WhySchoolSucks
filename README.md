# WhySchoolSucks
A website I made using a website development tutorial, with a few changes of course. It's a website just explaining why school is so bad.

To use the "website" follow the instructions below.

1. Unpack the .zip file with Winrar or something.
2. Open the Home.html file in something like Visual Studio Code or something.
3. Run the file, and select whatever browser that shows in the options.
4. Look at the stunning website.
